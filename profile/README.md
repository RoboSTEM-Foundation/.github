# Welcome!

## What is RoboSTEM?
[RoboSTEM](https://robostem.org) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, run completely by students. In an ever-changing world, we empower the next generation to rise and create through the power of robotics, engineering, and STEM. 

## About Us
We are a group of high schoolers and middle schoolers with a passion for robotics and education. RoboSTEM began as a small group helping each other on Discord, and grew to a YouTube channel with over 3,800 subscribers. Since then, we’ve grown into a nationwide network (CA & MA) offering workshops and coaching, all led by young creators.
